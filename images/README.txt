Put your puzzle picture here.

1. Add an image file named: puzzle.jpg
   (Or use another name and update the path in js/app.js – search for "puzzleImageUrl")

2. Recommended: square image (e.g. 600x600 or 900x900 px) so the 3x3 pieces look even.

3. The puzzle page will split this image into 9 pieces; users drag them into the board to complete it.
